# HandySpot-Desktop-App-
Desktop app for Working professionals and Students use
My project is a software/application titled ‘HandySpot’ which is very much useful for working professional and students. The prime aim of these software is to make the work for the user more easier with an attractive Graphical User Interface(GUI) for all the elements available in the software. The software contains various elements like ‘Speech To Text’, ‘Image To Text’, ‘Email Gateway’ etc. in a single interface which ensures that the user will not have to go to different places for different works. From converting ‘Speech to Text’ to noting down small notes, from converting ‘Image to Text’ to sending bulk emails in one go, these software comprises of all the basic need for the user to get his/her work done easily and in a faster manner.

This project is a group project made by me and my classmate 'YAMAN GOYAL' during our graduation semester 1.
